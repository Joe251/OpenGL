## Progress of learning OpenGL

### Vertex Buffers
The GPU should be told the layout of the buffer, like how many values are assigned to X, Y e.t.c. 
!!! Vertex is way more than position, it can contains more data.
!!! glVertexAttribPointer: stride means how many bytes should be jumped from one point to the next point
    e.g, Point:(attr1: 10 bytes, attr2: 12 bytes, attr3: 10 bytes), 32 bytes should be jumped shifting from point1 to point2
